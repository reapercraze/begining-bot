The paper trading account by binance does not have all the functionality of a real account. 
For example, the account can only trade 6 coins, BNB, BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, TRX, with 2 stable coins BUSD and USDT.

I can still get an order to the exchange but since I cannot use any other coins you cannot find arbitrage opportunities.
And plus the coins in the paper account don't relect real prices.
